# frontend-mentor-tic-tac-toe

Challenge taken and available from : https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tic-tac-toe-game-Re7ZF_E2v

## Stack

I decided to try TypeScript for the first time when completing this challenge back in June-July 2022.
This was due to the fact my workplace used TypeScript with all React projects and I wanted to practice
and learn some TS before potentially moving onto any react projects.

Outside of the use of TS, it's all normal web stacks such as HTML/CSS, no other libraries/frameworks.

Feel free to send me any feedback, but beware I only did this 4-5 months into being a developer.

## Learning since

As this is my most recent (yet quite old) project on GitHub, i'm hoping to incorporate better coding practices
and other frameworks / libraries such as Next/React/modularising CSS etc into a new front-end project as soon
I get macaulayeden.lol fully running with a load balanced NEXT.JS app as a basic resume page.
